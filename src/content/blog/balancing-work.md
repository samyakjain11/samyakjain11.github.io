Coming into Bloomberg, I was told about the incredible work life balance- like most cultural aspects of any large company I failed to recognize that this was yet again a team dependent claim. I now find myself on a "fast-paced team" focused on delivering features to clients. For some context, I have been a full time software engineer for about 4 months at this point (2 of which were training), and to this day, I have delivered 3 high-"ish" priority items, and been working on finishing up a project that was committed to clients for Q4 delivery that touches a fair amount of logic in our codebase.

Something I have struggled with the past two months is drawing that firm boundary between work and life. The problem is that I truly enjoy my work which is a curse in disguise. Mark Twain once said that “find a job you enjoy doing, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”. I did exactly that- I found myself something that I genuinely enjoy doing, I enjoy delivering features and writing code so much so that I would do it in my free time- which is the root cause of this problem.
<br> <br> 
When I first started on my team, I often found myself going home and opening my laptop to continue debugging, doing research, or worse writing code. These arent often bad things to do, but because I just started and am completely new to the team, these overtime sessions were not nearly providing any producitivity. I would spend close to 5 hours debugging at home over the weekend only to find out the issue was something simple that my mentor pointed out in seconds.
<br> <br> 
To this end, I realized recently that none of my team are workaholics unless the circumstances force them to be- which is extremely rare. This was all pressure that I was putting on myself this whole time to deliver deliever deliver. In one of my recent 1-on-1's, I asked my mentor about my worries of not delivering something in time for the deadline that I'd promised. His response was simple yet so incredibly comforting- "If things take time, they take time. There's nothing you can do about that". You would think that would be the end of the story and that everything was perfect after but it wasnt.
<br> <br> 
Even though I was not as stressed about finishing or delivering on a deadline, the voice inside my head would bother me and tell me to work on soemthing or fix it because I now knew how to fix it. I havent figured out how to battle this issue yet, at least completely. I was able to make this issue better for myself through observations. I found myself working about 7-8 hours in the office, and coming home to continue working for 1-2 additional hours. While I didnt mind this setup, I felt like I was losing myself to work while being in my early 20s in New York City. (This is my time to experience life?!??!). The past two weeks, I have started going into work earlier and staying till later to get about 9-10 hours of work in- this allows me to meet my deadlines and more importantly come home leave my backpack in the closet and not touch it until the morning after. My days are now substantially longer, but I feel that at least there is now a separation between work and life.
