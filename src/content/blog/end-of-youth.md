I miss the weightlessness of being small,

When time moved slow and stakes felt small.

No clocks to race, no plans to keep,

Just endless days and dreamless sleep.
<br><br>
I miss not thinking ten steps ahead,

Not lying awake in a busy head.

I miss the quiet, the unearned peace,

Before life demanded a steady lease.
<br><br>
I think I’ve reached the “end of youth,”

The line Ed sang, a haunting truth.

Where carefree fades, replaced by care,

And the world feels heavier everywhere.
<br><br>
But still, I stand in this strange new place,

Wearing the years like a borrowed face.

Not who I was, not yet complete,

Just finding my way with reluctant feet.
