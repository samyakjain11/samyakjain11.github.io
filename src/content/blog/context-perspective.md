To live under the assumption that everyone shares the same context is to blind oneself to the rich complexity of human experience—a form of ignorance that limits understanding and connection. The principle of **Anekantavad**, a cornerstone of Jain philosophy, reminds us that ultimate truth is multifaceted and can never be fully grasped from a single perspective. This profound insight humbles us, highlighting the impossibility of truly knowing the entirety of another’s internal world. Embracing this awareness invites us to re-examine even the smallest interactions, considering the unseen external forces and unspoken struggles that shape others’ realities—forces we may have overlooked or failed to honor.

The dynamic relationship between context and perspective determines how reality is constructed. Context acts as the canvas, while perspective is the brush that paints reality. Together, they shape what people perceive as true or important. To take it a level deeper, the interplay between context and perspective is not static; it is a continuous feedback loop. The interaction between context and perspective creates a unique interpretation of reality for each individual or group. This co-construction of meaning makes reality a dynamic and multifaceted experience rather than a singular, objective truth. Perspective can influence context, particularly in social or cultural settings. For example, collective perspectives can shape societal norms or reshape the physical environment, thereby altering the context for future interactions. By analyzing the intersection of context and perspective, we gain insight into the multifaceted nature of human experience, illuminating how people assign meaning to their world and navigate its complexities.

When interacting with others, remember that their perspective is shaped by their unique experiences, and their actions are influenced by the context they’re in—approach with empathy and curiosity.
