To assume a shared context is to close one’s eyes— <br>
To the infinite textures of existence,<br>
To the quiet storms within another’s being.<br>
This blindness,<br>
A fragile comfort,<br>
Denies the depth of the human story.<br>
<br>
Anekantavad whispers:<br>
Truth is not singular.<br>
It splinters into countless shards,<br>
Each reflecting a fragment,<br>
None revealing the whole.<br>
It humbles us,<br>
This impossibility of knowing,<br>
This vast silence between one world and another.<br>
<br>
Consider this:<br> 
Every gesture, every word,<br>
Is shaped by invisible currents—<br>
Histories unwritten, battles unseen,<br>
A context that cannot be borrowed,<br>
A perspective carved by time.<br>
<br>
Context, the canvas.<br>
Perspective, the brush.<br>
Together they compose a reality<br>
That shifts as it is seen,<br>
A kaleidoscope of meaning.<br>
<br>
And yet, they do not rest.<br>
They spiral,<br>
Context shaping perspective,<br>
Perspective reshaping context,<br>
A ceaseless motion,<br>
A co-creation of worlds.<br>
<br>
What is real? What is true?<br>
It is not fixed, but alive—<br>
A fleeting constellation<br>
Of shared and unshared understanding.<br>
<br>
So, approach gently.<br>
Hold your questions with care.<br>
To truly meet another<br>
Is not to know,<br>
But to witness,<br>
To honor the unseen forces<br>
That shape their reality.<br>
<br>
Let curiosity lead,<br>
Let empathy soften the edges.<br>
In this,<br>
Perhaps, we just might become more human.<br>
