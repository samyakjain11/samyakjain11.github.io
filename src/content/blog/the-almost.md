With every year, the dream drifts further, <br> 
like sand slipping through open fingers. <br> 
Will I ever hold it, <br> 
or will I watch it dissolve into the tide? <br> 


I ask the sky, the stars, the silent walls <br> 
Am I falling behind? <br> 
Am I living up to the sacrifice of all generations  <br> 
All stories that came before mine? <br> 
Or am I just watching, waiting, <br> 
as my chance fades into a story of almost? <br> 


I have high aspirations, <br> 
a hunger that burns through my chest, <br> 
a longing too sharp to ignore. <br> 
But fear lingers in the quiet moments <br> 
what if I never get there? <br> 
What if the throne I reach for <br> 
was never meant for my hands? <br> 


"Everybody wants to rule the world," they say, <br> 
but what if I want more than just power? <br> 
What if I want to be seen, to be followed, <br> 
to be a light in the dark  <br> 
yet still have the grace to admit <br> 
I have stumbled along the way? <br> 


I have made mistakes. <br> 
I have cracked and broken <br> 
and rebuilt myself from the pain. <br> 
But I would not change a single misstep, <br> 
I would not rewrite a single regret. <br> 


All because someone wonderful once told me, <br> 
"Don’t regret the past, it’s what got you here." <br> 
And I would do nothing to turn back the time, <br> 
for this is my story, and every scar, every choice,  <br> 
every whispered doubt <br> 
has shaped the person standing before you today. <br>
