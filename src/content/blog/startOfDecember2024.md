It’s been a long, unyielding year, <br> 
A seesaw of joy and shadow near.<br> 
I hold my tongue, though it aches to say,<br> 
Hadn’t I earned a stiller day?<br> 
<br> <br> 
In December’s hush, I sought reprieve,<br> 
A quiet pause—a chance to breathe.<br> 
But life, that cunning trickster wise,<br> 
Strikes swift beneath unguarded skies.<br> 
<br> <br> 
Perhaps the storm is the lesson clear,<br> 
That peace comes not from fleeing fear.<br> 
Yet still, I dream of calmer streams,<br> 
A fleeting rest, a softer dream.<br>
