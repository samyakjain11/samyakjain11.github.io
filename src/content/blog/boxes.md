Walking home, I saw someone  <br>
Rolling a suitcase behind them,  <br>
Its small, rigid frame holding  <br>
A fraction of a life—  <br>
Three, maybe four cubic feet,  <br>
Packed tightly for a brief escape. <br> 
<br><br>
How strange, I thought,  <br>
That we do this every day.  <br>
We pack ourselves, unseen,  <br>
Folding lifetimes of stories  <br>
Into the small, fragile box  <br>
Of our brains.  <br>
<br><br>
Some boxes are lanterns,  <br>
Glowing softly on mantels.  <br>
They hold the parts of us  <br>
We want the world to notice—  <br>
Light spilling through cracks  <br>
To cast shapes on the walls.  <br>
These are the ones we offer, <br> 
Open-lidded,  <br>
To anyone who asks the right question.  <br>
But the glow is deceiving.  <br>
<br><br>
Others are vaults.  <br>
They sit buried, locked beneath layers of dust and doubt.  <br>
The hinges creak with the weight of what they guard.  <br>
Here lies the rubble of days that no one else saw—  <br>
Fragments of feelings we can’t name,  <br>
Memories we press down until they’re barely recognizable. <br> 
Sometimes, even we forget what’s inside.  <br>
<br><br>
I carry mine everywhere,  <br>
A strange procession of light and shadow.  <br>
I wonder what people see when they look,  <br>
If they notice the way I clutch and don't let go <br>
And then there’s you—  <br>
A stranger standing before me.  <br>
How do I begin to open my vaults?  <br>
How do I decide which lanterns to light?  <br>
<br><br>
Vulnerability feels like a dangerous gamble.  <br>
What if the glow of my lanterns  <br>
Isn’t enough to hold your attention?  <br>
What if my vaults crack open too soon,  <br>
Spilling jagged truths at your feet?  <br>
What if you step closer,  <br>
Only to decide you’d rather walk away?  <br>
<br><br>
I’ve spent years practicing the art <br> 
Of keeping my vaults closed,  <br>
Polishing my lanterns just enough  <br>
To seem like I’m whole.  <br>
But maybe—just maybe—  <br>
I could begin with something small,  <br>
A single shard of glass,  <br>
Held out with trembling hands.  <br>
<br><br>
And perhaps you’ll do the same.<br>
We’ll trade our fragments,<br>
Softly, tentatively,<br>
Until the space between us  <br>
Fills with the warmth of new light,  <br>
Flickering, unsteady, but shared.  <br>
And maybe one day,  <br>
We’ll learn to stand together  <br>
Among our lanterns and vaults,  <br>
No longer strangers,  <br>
But something braver.<br>
